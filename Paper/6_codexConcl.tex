\section*{Conclusion}


Future work includes gathering more fine-grained data on the individual delegates to fully test Halliday et al. (2013)'s arguments. 


In future work, we will explore the extent to which increasing participation affects not only the efficiency of the policy process, but the representativeness of the resulting policy. In the case of Codex, this means investigating the extent to which a certain standard is created for a narrow or broader range of commodities.  

Future work is also needed to explore the extent to which Codex standards are actually being adopted and implemented by member states, what explains variation in adoption and how adoption when it happens affects trade and food safety outcomes.
